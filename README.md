This repository showcases my journey through the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) Data Analytics program. It includes hands-on projects demonstrating my skills in data analysis, visualization, and reporting using tools like Excel and SQL.

**Excel**: Advanced data manipulation with functions like VLOOKUP, IF, pivot tables, and dynamic visualizations.

**SQL**: Database querying, filtering, joins, and aggregation to extract actionable insights.

**Data Insights**: Reports summarizing key findings and data-driven recommendations.

This collection highlights my ability to analyze data, solve real-world problems, and present meaningful insights.

### Data Sources
The datasets used in this repository come from a variety of publicly available sources, as well as sample data provided through the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) Data Analytics program. Each dataset has been selected to help develop and demonstrate key data analysis skills, including data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and reporting.

Notable data sources include:

**Public datasets**: Available through online platforms like Kaggle, government databases, and academic resources.
**Sample datasets**: Provided as part of LITA's curriculum for hands-on learning and practical application of Excel and SQL techniques.
