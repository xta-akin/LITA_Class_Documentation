### Project Title: Data Analytics Mastery: A Journey with LITA

### Project Overview
---
This repository showcases my journey through the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) Data Analytics program. It includes hands-on projects demonstrating my skills in data analysis, visualization, and reporting using tools like Excel and SQL.

- **Excel**: Advanced data manipulation with functions like VLOOKUP, IF, pivot tables, and dynamic visualizations.

- **SQL**: Database querying, filtering, joins, and aggregation to extract actionable insights.

 - **Data Insights**: Reports summarizing key findings and data-driven recommendations.

This collection highlights my ability to analyze data, solve real-world problems, and present meaningful insights.

### Data Sources
---
The datasets used in this repository come from a variety of publicly available sources, as well as sample data provided through the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) Data Analytics program. Each dataset has been selected to help develop and demonstrate key data analysis skills, including data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and reporting.

Notable data sources include:

**Public datasets**: Available through online platforms like Kaggle, government databases, and academic resources.

**Sample datasets**: Provided as part of LITA's curriculum for hands-on learning and practical application of Excel and SQL techniques.

Each project folder includes the corresponding dataset, along with a brief description of its origin and relevance to the specific analysis.

### Tools Used
---
Throughout the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) Data Analytics program, we’ve worked with several essential tools to develop and refine our data analysis skills. These include:

- **Microsoft Excel**: [Download Here](https://gtbank-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/esther_akintujoye/EbZwglF38apArkFuBJ7VmU4BpwtrqjEBwbAcTioMwOe_TA?e=1GRHwK)
  1. Used for data cleaning
  2. Used for manipulation, advanced analysis
  3. Used for Analysis and data visualization
  
 _**We explored functions like VLOOKUP, IF statements, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and data visualization tools such as charts and graphs to interpret datasets.**_

- **SQL**:Structured Query Language (SQL)[Download Here]()
  1. It was a key tool for querying databases
  2. Performing data extraction
  3. Filtering, aggregation
  4. Conducting relational database analysis.
  
 **This allowed us to efficiently work with large datasets and gain deeper insights.**
_
- **GitHub**: A version control platform used for managing and sharing our projects. We created repositories to track progress, organize code, and collaborate.

Each of these tools has been instrumental in building a solid foundation for effective data analysis, enabling us to transform raw data into actionable insights.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
Data cleaning and preparation are crucial steps in the data analysis process, ensuring that datasets are accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Throughout the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) program, we've focused on mastering these essential techniques:

1. **Handling Missing Data**: Identifying and addressing missing or incomplete data by using methods like imputation or removal, depending on the context.
2. **Data Validation**: Ensuring data integrity through consistency checks, removing duplicates, and identifying outliers that may skew analysis results.
3. **Data Formatting**: Standardizing data formats, including date formats, numerical values, and text, to ensure uniformity across datasets.
4. **Data Transformation**: Applying functions such as splitting, merging, and normalizing data to make it easier to analyze, particularly for tasks like summarizing, grouping, or pivoting data.

These processes were implemented using tools like Excel, for basic data manipulation, and SQL, for cleaning larger datasets within databases. Data cleaning lays the foundation for producing reliable, high-quality analyses.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a vital part of the data analysis process, allowing analysts to understand datasets through visualizations and statistical techniques. In the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) program, we employed EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Key components of our EDA efforts included:

1. **Data Visualization**: Utilizing tools like Excel’s charts and graphs to create visual representations of data, helping to highlight key trends, distributions, and correlations.
2. **Summary Statistics**: Calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range to gain insights into the central tendencies and variability within datasets.
3.  **Distribution Analysis**: Examining the distribution of variables through histograms and box plots to identify outliers and understand data spread.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Assessing relationships between variables using scatter plots and correlation coefficients to determine potential dependencies or associations.

Through EDA, we developed a deeper understanding of our data, allowing us to formulate hypotheses and direct subsequent analyses effectively.

### Data Analysis
---
Data analysis is the core of the data analytics process, where we apply various techniques and tools to extract meaningful insights from the data. Throughout the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) program, we employed both SQL queries and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in our analyses to perform complex calculations and aggregations.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
