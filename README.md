### Project Title: Data Analytics Mastery: A Journey with LITA

### Project Overview
This repository showcases my journey through the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) Data Analytics program. It includes hands-on projects demonstrating my skills in data analysis, visualization, and reporting using tools like Excel and SQL.

- **Excel**: Advanced data manipulation with functions like VLOOKUP, IF, pivot tables, and dynamic visualizations.

- **SQL**: Database querying, filtering, joins, and aggregation to extract actionable insights.

  - **Data Insights**: Reports summarizing key findings and data-driven recommendations.

This collection highlights my ability to analyze data, solve real-world problems, and present meaningful insights.

### Data Sources
The datasets used in this repository come from a variety of publicly available sources, as well as sample data provided through the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) Data Analytics program. Each dataset has been selected to help develop and demonstrate key data analysis skills, including data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and reporting.

Notable data sources include:

**Public datasets**: Available through online platforms like Kaggle, government databases, and academic resources.
**Sample datasets**: Provided as part of LITA's curriculum for hands-on learning and practical application of Excel and SQL techniques.

Each project folder includes the corresponding dataset, along with a brief description of its origin and relevance to the specific analysis.

### Tools Used
Throughout the Ladies in Tech Africa (LITA) Data Analytics program, weâ€™ve worked with several essential tools to develop and refine our data analysis skills. These include:

- **Microsoft Excel**: [Download Here](https://gtbank-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/esther_akintujoye/EbZwglF38apArkFuBJ7VmU4BpwtrqjEBwbAcTioMwOe_TA?e=1GRHwK)
  1. Used for data cleaning
  2. Used for manipulation, advanced analysis
  3. Used for Analysis and data visualization
  
 _**We explored functions like VLOOKUP, IF statements, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and data visualization tools such as charts and graphs to interpret datasets.**_

- **SQL**:Structured Query Language (SQL)[Download Here]()
  1. It was a key tool for querying databases
  2. Performing data extraction
  3. Filtering, aggregation
  4. Conducting relational database analysis.
  
 **This allowed us to efficiently work with large datasets and gain deeper insights.**
_
- **GitHub**: A version control platform used for managing and sharing our projects. We created repositories to track progress, organize code, and collaborate.

Each of these tools has been instrumental in building a solid foundation for effective data analysis, enabling us to transform raw data into actionable insights.
